## üß† Key Design Choices

* **Async AI Calls:** Decouples user response from AI latency.
* **Redis Caching:** Speeds up high-traffic endpoints.
* **UUID-based IDs:** Secure & non-sequential entity identifiers.
* **Tiered Plans:** Scalable for monetization.

---

## üß™ Testing

* Import `Thoughtflow.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
* Set `{{baseUrl}}` to your local or Render URL.
* Run signup ‚Üí OTP flow ‚Üí authenticated requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

* [ ] Real OTP provider (e.g. Twilio)
* [ ] WebSocket-based real-time messaging
* [ ] Admin dashboard
* [ ] User analytics & conversation insights
* [ ] Fine-tuning / custom AI agents

Would you like me to tailor this README more **like a developer tool** (for other devs to use the backend) or **like a product landing page** (if you want to make it public)?
üëâ This will change the tone and sections (e.g., API docs vs. marketing pitch).
